;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides easy project management and navigation.  The
;; concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing
;; special file.  Currently git, mercurial and bazaar repos are
;; considered projects by default.  If you want to mark a folder
;; manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in
;; it.  See the README for more details.
;;
;;; Code:

(require 'projectile)

(defcustom projectile-cmake-compilation-dir-name "build"
  "The name of the folder used for compilation."
  :group 'projectile
  :type '(string))

;; (defcustom projectile-cmake-generator-type "Ninja"
;;   "The generator used."
;;   :group 'projectile
;;   :type '(choice
;;           (const :tag "Ninja" nil)
;;           (const :tag "Makefile" file-remote-p)
;;           function)
;;   :package-version '(projectile . "0.13.0"))


(defun projectile-cmake-compilation-path ()
  "The Path the build directory."
  (message (bound-and-true-p projectile-project-root))
  (if (boundp 'projectile-compilation-dir)
      (projectile-compilation-dir)
    (concat projectile-project-root
	    projectile-cmake-compilation-dir-name)
    ))

(defun projectile-cmake-compdb-path ()
  "Return the path to the compdb file."
