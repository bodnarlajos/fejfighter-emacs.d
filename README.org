* Fejfighter's emacs config

This is my long suffering emacs configuration, feel free to steal bits or the whole lot, I've done the same in some form or another.
As this tends to be a focussed, rather than an all encomapssing history of my work, so it does get culled or cleaned up when I feel that way inclined.
Sometimes this occurs quite abruptly.

** Use cases
Primarily I have been a C programmer for most of the life of this config and it still takes pride of place, more recently I have taken on C++ work which is disctinct in emacs, but similar enough that config isn't too hard.
This is tradtionally paired with Cmake for my projects, but has seen some meson work as well.
Outside of paid work, I have some stuff setup for rust to investigate.

** Quirks
*** Prefers `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
At least on linux, my config is found in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, usually `$HOME/.config/emacs` rather than just `$HOME/.emacs`.
Then all compiled files are output and loaded from `XDG_CACHE_HOME` and finally any downloaded packages or on-the-fly config files are in `XDG_DATA_DIR`.
This should keep the emacs config dir git clean, and for my specific case, I have it bind mounted read-only from another location that is easier to reach.
My motivation for this setup is to ensure that changes shown on `git status` are things that I am to blame for.

*** Somewhat Uses MacOS equivalents
Some of the above applies to equivalent mac cache folders.

*** Aggressively Follows Savannah/master branch
I track upstream and rebuild almost everyday, but it means there might are likely to be changes to interfaces
